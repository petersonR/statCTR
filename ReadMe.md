# StatCTR website

This is a Quarto website for the statistical consulting training resources initiative. The website is hosted at https://petersonr.github.io/statCTR/, and will soon be also hosted at statCTR.com.

It is currently mostly a placeholder. The To-do list is the "Issues" page; please create a new issue to add items to the to-do list for this website.
